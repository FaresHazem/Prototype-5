# Prototype-5
This repository contains Prototype 5, featuring Clicky Crates, where players click on flying crates to score while avoiding bombs, and Whack-a-Food, where food spawns in a 4x4 grid, and players must click before it disappears. Both focus on reaction-based gameplay, object spawning, and score tracking.
